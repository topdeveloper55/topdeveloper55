Hello everyone!
I am a full stack developer who has more than 8 years of experiences in software development. Until now, I developed many projects including Website, Desktop app, Mobile app and dapp. My main programming language is JavaScript, TypeScript and python.
While I use MERN stack in website development, Electron in desktop app, react native in mobile app. Also I am very familiar with Django as backend framework.
Especially, in the past I have enough experiences with developing dapp such as NFT projet and DeFi app. My main tech stack in dapp development is react, web3, Node.js and solidity. 
I used MUI as UI kit, redux as state management, web3.js and ethers.js module in frontend development.
Also, I used solidity, hardhat for testing and deploying in smart contract development, while using node.js, Django as backend.
In the past, I developed NFT marketplace, NFT minting project, DEX protocol , staking platform(similar to OlympusDao).
We can discuss what to do in detail via email, skype or other communication apps. My skype id is “live:.cid.d995c163d3f0d178” and email is “rioneymar644@gmail.com”
Best regards.
